SVG has some predefined shape elements that can be used by developers:

Rectangle <rect>
Circle <circle>
Ellipse <ellipse>
Line <line>
Polyline <polyline>
Polygon <polygon>
Path <path>

The cx and cy attributes define the x and y coordinates of the center of the circle. If cx and cy are omitted, the circle's center is set to (0,0)
The r attribute defines the radius of the circle
